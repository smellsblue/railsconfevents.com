# RailsConfEvents.com

This is a simple Rails application intended to be a community driven
repository of the official and unofficial events happening during (and
surrounding) RailsConf 2015. If it goes well, then it could be a site that
sticks around for every RailsConf to list past and present RailsConf events.

# Ideas?

Go ahead and open an issue on GitHub! If you want to dive in to the code, go
ahead and submit a pull request. If you like, you can message me about it.

# Got an event?

Visit https://railsconfevents.com/ and submit your event! If you create an
account first, you will be able to see the event before it gets approved.
Creating an account is as simple as clicking the Sign In / Register link, and
then logging in via GitHub. You can also edit events if you created an
account first.

Please note that I reserve the right to filter obscene or otherwise offensive
events, and approving an event is by no means an endorsement of that event by
me or anyone else. Was all that really necessary to say? I think our
community is pretty awesome, so I trust only awesome and inclusive events
will be listed!
